YouTube Downloader (YTD) Application README

🎤 Using the YTD Application 

🐍 Visit the web app hosted here: (app gets blocked by YouTube sign-in - looking for a fix).

😿 If the site is down you may also follow the steps below:

1. Download and Extract the contents of the Zipped folder.
2. Open the YTD folder and double click the app.py.
3. Ctrl + Left Click on the 'http://' address that appears in the cmd window.
4. A new window with the app should open up.

(I'm learning that on different computers, you must install Python, then run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in a code editor like VSCode for the app.py to work properly).
